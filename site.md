#### Site Documentation.

#### List of plugins used to modify the look of the site: 
Events Calendar WD - which self describes as an “easy event management and planning tool with advanced features.”. 
This was the plugin used to simplify and present creating events and showcasing them on a calendar.
  
MetaSlider - “easy to use slideshow plugin. Create SEO optimised responsive slideshows”. 
This was used to create dynamic galleries, to better present and showcase the rich history and community the jazz club has.

#### Site Structure and organisation
The sites content was split up and organised into pages. The content has been displayed this way because of the need to cut a line 
and separate the extensive history present on the original site and the incredibly necessary information that needs to be clearly presented to members, 
without cutting anything. Each page contains its relevant information, and nothing more. 
This reduced the wordiness and clutter of the site and allowed important information to be visible.
If any info or content is to be added, for example updated membership information, the relevant page should simply be edited as usual through WordPress visual editor.

In regard to image slides and events, plugins were used. MetaSlider and Events Calendar WD have their own plugin backends to work through. 
These are described below, they are however pretty straightforward as it is a lot of just filling in information, the plug in does the rest.
