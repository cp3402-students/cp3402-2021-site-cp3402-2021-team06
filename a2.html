  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>The goal of the new Townsville Jazz Club website is to entice visitors to become members. How well the website is achieving this goal can be measured by comparing the average number of monthly sign-ups the club receives before and after the new website is made live<br>Target Audience: Younger People
Accessibility: Idiot proof, website is easy to edit and understand.
Maintenance: Site will have to manage itself as no one will use it frequently to update it.
Goal: To get more people interested in Jazz and get more members to sign up for their events
Success Evaluation: If the site is easy to use and the appropriate call to actions seem successful in getting users to join then we can consider this a success. The success condition is if the user gets to the membership page.</p>

  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>Brief description of local environments used by team members<br><br>
    <u>Zachariah March</u><br>
    I utilized the free server solution package, XAMPP to host my local environment. To setup my local development environment, I installed Wordpress in the XAMPP directory and pulled the theme files from the github repository into the Wordpress themes folder. To push and pull changes from the repository, GitHub Desktop was used. PHPStorm was used to make edits to the various PHP and CSS files of the theme.
    <br><br>
    <u>Hayden Hartley</u><br>
    My local environment was set up using XAMPP to quickly & easily create local wordpress websites. For editing .md documents and looking at the code, Atom was used alongside the in-browser inspector. Changes to the wp-content folder were made in a seperate branch then pull requested into the master branch using Git Bash.
    <br><br>
    <u>Brandon Claybourn</u><br>
    I also used XAMPP in my local environment setup, I found it the best for me personally and setting it up was incredibly straight forward. Any changes to the Github was done with PHPstorm as it is what i have used before. For version control and git flow i utilised Git bash. For migrating all the pages found on the site between environments i used Wordmove.
