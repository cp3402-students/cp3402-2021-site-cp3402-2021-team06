  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>Brief description of local environments used by team members<br><br>
    <u>Zachariah March</u><br>
    I utilized the free server solution package, XAMPP to host my local environment. To setup my local development environment, I installed Wordpress in the XAMPP directory and pulled the theme files from the github repository into the Wordpress themes folder. To push and pull changes from the repository, GitHub Desktop was used. PHPStorm was used to make edits to the various PHP and CSS files of the theme.
    <br><br>
    <u>Hayden Hartley</u><br>
    My local environment was set up using XAMPP to quickly & easily create local wordpress websites. For editing .md documents and looking at the code, Atom was used alongside the in-browser inspector. Changes to the wp-content folder were made in a seperate branch then pull requested into the master branch using Git Bash.
    <br><br>
    <u>Brandon Claybourn</u><br>
    I also used XAMPP in my local environment setup, I found it the best for me personally and setting it up was incredibly straight forward. Any changes to the Github was done with PHPstorm as it is what i have used before. For version control and git flow i utilised Git bash. For migrating all the pages found on the site between environments i used Wordmove.
    <br><br>
    <u>Jack Stewart</u><br>
    For my local environment I used the recommended set up we have outlined in the GitHub (A Vagrant LAMP stack). From what I understand it is the industry standard and it is super easy to recreate for multiple users and websites.
